Hi there! Welcome to my home page. 

I'm ChiEnn (Cheng) Cheng, an AI researcher with a keen focus on biomathematics. 

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics and Statistics at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, University of Malaya. My academic journey involves extensive research in data analysis and biomathematics, particularly exploring the potential of deep learning in these fields. My early research includes significant work on earthquake data during my sophomore year. For a more detailed overview of my work, please visit my [research page](/_pages/research.md)




If you'd like to get in contact with me, simply email me at [chingycheng327@gmail.com](mailto:chingycheng327@gmail.com).
